In Next.js 15, a subtle issue can arise when using the `async/await` pattern within `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` alongside data fetching from an external API.  If the API request fails, the error might not be properly handled, leading to a silent failure or an unexpected behavior.  The typical `try...catch` block might not capture the error effectively, especially if the error occurs within the asynchronous operation of the data fetching.
